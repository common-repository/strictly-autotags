Strictly AutoTags is a plugin that scans an English language post for words that could be used as tags and then orders them so that the most relevant
words get added against the post. Just because a word appears in a post that is already in your list of tags does not mean that it should
automatically be added against the article. Therefore the plugin orders all matching tags in descending order and picks only those that occur the most.

As well as using existing tags to work out which words to tag posts with this plugin automatically detects new words to use as tags 
by using a simple rule of thumb I have discovered during my time using Wordpress as a blogging tool. I have found that over 90% of all
tags I use fall into one of the following three categories: Acronyms e.g CIA, FBI, AIG, IT, SQL, ASP, names of people or places and countries.
Therefore using the power of regular expressions I scan posts for words or sentences that match these three groups and then store them
as potential tag candidates.

The more posts are added to a blog the more tags will get added but the good thing about this plugin is that having no existing tags 
stored in your Wordpress DB isn't a bar from using it as it will auto detect suitable tags whenever it comes across them.

Whereas other tag plugins only detect a single occurance of a tag this plugin will search for the most used tags within the content so that 
only relevant tags get added. If you set the MaxTags option to 5 then it will pick the top 5 occurring tags within the post and ignore all others.
The RankTitle option when set means that tags found in the post title are automatically added to the post even if they only occur once and only within
the title.

This plugin is not a replacement for other tag related plugims such as Smart Tags as it doesn't even try to manage the tags within your blog.
The plugin is designed to do one thing and one thing only which is to add the most relevant and appropriate tags to your posts as well as discovering new
tags on the way with as little effort as possible.

Please note this plugin is designed for the English language and will not work with UTF-8 characters.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Download the plugin.
2. Unzip the strictly-autotags compressed file.
3. Upload the directory strictlyautotags to the /wp-content/plugins directory on your WordPress blog.
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
5. Use the newly created Admin option within Wordpress titled Strictly AutoTags to set the configuration for the plugin.
6. Read carefully all the options and the possible settings that could effect the plugins behaviour and the notes under each option.
7. Tags will now automatically be added to all posts that are added or edited that don't currently have tags associated with it.

Help 

Read this article and supply all the information you can please http://blog.strictly-software.com/2014/04/how-to-send-developer-useful.html

1. If you add a post but no tags are added then it does not mean the plugin is not working just that no tags could be found to associate with the post.

2. Test the plugin is working by creating a new post with the following content and saving it as a draft:

Article Title: The CIA now admits responsibility for torture at Guantanamo Bay

Content: Today the CIA admitted it was responsible for the recent accusations of torture at Guantanamo Bay.

Billy Bob Johnson, the chief station manager at the Guantanamo Bay prison said that the USA had to hold its hands up and admit that it had allowed its CIA operatives to feed the prisoners nothing but McDonalds and Kentucky Fried Chicken meals whilst forcing them to listen to Christian Rock Music for up to 20 hour periods at a time without any break.

The CIA apologised for the allegations and promised to review its policy of using fast food and Christian Rock Music as a method of torture.

3. Save the draft post and check the number of tags that get added. The plugin should have found a number of words to use even if you have no existing saved tags in your site. It is always best to save the article as a draft, check which tags have been used, remove or add any yourself before publishing an article.

4. Some people have complained that they have added words to the stop/noise word list which still get tagged and think the plugin is broken. This is not the case and the problem is usually that the user hasn't removed any new noise words from the system first BEFORE re-scanning. The noise words are only used in the auto discovery stage of the auto tagging and if tags have already been saved in the system then the site will use them in it's relevancy check whether or not they have been marked as noise words. Version 2.0 has a new option to aid the easy removal of noise words from the saved post tag list and this option should be run whenever new noise words are added.

5. If you have articles with lots of capital words in the title e.g THIS IS A TEST ARTICLE or body then set the Ignore Capital Percentage to a level appropriate for your site. Otherwise words will be treated as acronyms when they shouldn't.

6. If you don't want the plugin to hunt out possible new tags for your site then turn Auto Discovery OFF. Then only existing saved post tags will be used to find relevant tags in new articles.

7. Auto Discovery will find new possible words to use as tags using the settings you give it so set them carefully. However if these new words are not found to be relevant to your article they won't get saved against the post OR in the system. Use the Rank Title and Rank HTML options to ensure words in the post title or already in special formatting HTML such as headers or strong tags are considered more relevant than other words.

8. If you have any problems make sure it not related to Wordpress, your server/hosting or other plugins before requesting support. 

9. Please check existing support tickets before writing a new support ticket as the problem may have already been answered. 

10. Always disable all other plugins and leave just Strictly AutoTags on before considering it the likely cause of a problem.

11. Read the post on https://www.facebook.com/strictlysoftware/posts/364830366999257 to see if this helps you.

12. If you are going to write a new support question that hasn't already been answered can you please provided the following information all which can be got from your host, WP, plugins, DB or a combination of e.g load a version of phpinfo.php onto your site but call it something else so hackers cannot guess it e.g my-3467phpINF.php etc
   -Version of PHP you are running (make sure it's compatible with the code)
   -Version of MySQL you are running (make sure it's compatible with the code)
   -Any error message you get when you run the routine that breaks.
   -The time it takes to run before breaking.
   -If you can hit F12 and view the console any Nework/JavaSccript errors you may have - also if you have lots of 404's due to missing files fix those as that will cause overhead. If you don't have them just create blank file with the same name.
   -If you can code, turn on the debug constant in the plugin, change your IP in the MyIP function to your own IP address (just type "What is my IP" into Google to get a valu, re-upload the file (after backing up) and send me the output of the debug.
   -If you have lots of browser add-ons try it in a fresh install of a new browser, e.g download Opera/Safari for windows and test it on that.
   -If possible install HTTP Fox on FireFox, open it, and then press play just before doing the action that causes the problem. This will give you all the HTTP requests and responses from the server. Look for any 500 status codes or errors. Send me anything unusual - and only related to my site/plugin as it will also record all the plugin guff from your FireFox extensions as well.
   -The more information the better, so screeen shots, video casts (free online, click play, do action, stop, send link etc).

To help ME find YOUR error and fix it easier and quicker please read this guide so you can provide me with the information I need http://blog.strictly-software.com/2014/04/how-to-send-developer-useful.html

If there is a problem I can only imagine it to be in the storage array which holds these values to prevent tagging by mistake. I am unsetting the array before and after storing/replacing to see if that will help.
* Also wrapping the init of the class in a static class so that if the object is loaded multiple times there is only a singleton not multiple instances. This might help as well.

= 2.8.5 =
* Updated storage array to store content between important content, bold, strong, headers and links etc. So they don't get tagged inside e.g put bolded words inside an existing h4 etc.
* Changed storage array to run "RETURN" twice to handle nested code because of previous change e.g <a href="##STORED##"><img src="##STORED##"></a>.

* Updated storage to handle new data-blah and data-blah-blah attributes so they don't get tagged inside images by mistake.
* Added new tag equivalent functionality using a simple method so that you can match instances of certain words BUT use a different tag for example [Snowden, NSA, PRISM]=[Police State] would allow the system to match the words Snowden, Prism and NSA but add a tag "Police State" (if relevant of course). You can use as many replacements as you want using a simple markup format. Allows for you to add a tag that may never appear in the article but is related to other words that do.
* I've added an option to set the minimum number of letters a tag must have before it is used as a tag. This applies to stored tags or newly found ones.
* Added option to tell system whether or not to convert plain text links e.g www.msnbc.com into real links before tagging e.g <a href="http://www.strictly-software.com">strictly-software.com</a>
* Created a new name function to match names like al-Qaeda or al-Nusra Front or even words with commas in like 1,000 Guineas which would be tagged as 1000 Guineas.

* Corrected some admin panel spelling mistakes and titles.
* Imporoved auto bold regex so words near end tags get matched that were not before now get matched.

* Added option to set minimum words a tag must have before being autotagged.
* Tightened up some regular expression for matching names and hyphenated strings.
* Updated the ReTagAndLink operation to store content, bold, deeplink, remove basic formatting, convert text to links and put the stored content (alt,title,data-blah,[youtube] etc) back in for each item in loop.
* Returned the "ReTagPosts" operation to just add new tags to a post. No linking or reformatting done on the article at all. The Re-Tag and Re-Format Posts option should be used for doing that.
